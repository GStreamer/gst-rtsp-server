This is GStreamer gst-rtsp-server 1.18.6.

The GStreamer team is thrilled to announce a new major feature release
of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!

As always, this release is again packed with new features, bug fixes and
other improvements.

The 1.18 release series adds new features on top of the 1.16 series and is
part of the API and ABI-stable 1.x release series of the GStreamer multimedia
framework.

Full release notes can be found at:

  https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.18/

Binaries for Android, iOS, Mac OS X and Windows will usually be provided
shortly after the release.

This module will not be very useful by itself and should be used in conjunction
with other GStreamer modules for a complete multimedia experience.

 - gstreamer: provides the core GStreamer libraries and some generic plugins

 - gst-plugins-base: a basic set of well-supported plugins and additional
                     media-specific GStreamer helper libraries for audio,
                     video, rtsp, rtp, tags, OpenGL, etc.

 - gst-plugins-good: a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred
                     license

 - gst-plugins-ugly: a set of well-supported plugins which might pose
                     problems for distributors

 - gst-plugins-bad: a set of plugins of varying quality that have not made
                    their way into one of core/base/good/ugly yet, for one
                    reason or another. Many of these are are production quality
                    elements, but may still be missing documentation or unit
                    tests; others haven't passed the rigorous quality testing
                    we expect yet.

 - gst-libav: a set of codecs plugins based on the ffmpeg library. This is
                    where you can find audio and video decoders and encoders
                    for a wide variety of formats including H.264, AAC, etc.

 - gstreamer-vaapi: hardware-accelerated video decoding and encoding using
                    VA-API on Linux. Primarily for Intel graphics hardware.

 - gst-omx: hardware-accelerated video decoding and encoding, primarily for
                    embedded Linux systems that provide an OpenMax
                    implementation layer such as the Raspberry Pi.

 - gst-rtsp-server: library to serve files or streaming pipelines via RTSP

 - gst-editing-services: library an plugins for non-linear editing
